The .R file *almaso_pipeline* gather all functions composing our pipeline.
The .R file *Seurat* is a basic Seurat pipeline to analyse scRNA-Seq data.
The .dox file *almaso_Project_recap* reports all the packages we tried and all choices made during the development of the pipeline. 

A package, named almaso, was created to keep track of all packages necessary.
